\section{Abstract}

We present our optimized selection criteria for the predicted Higgs coupling to dimuons with associated 
production of a vector boson. On July 4th 2012, the discovery of the Higgs boson was announced by the 
ATLAS and Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) collaborations in data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the 
European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Researchers must search for the rare decay modes of 
the Higgs, as predicted in the Standard Model of Particle Physics, to confirm its predicted couplings to 
mass. We are contributing to that process by developing a dedicated search strategy for the Higgs decay to 
dimuons, with associated production of a W or Z vector boson detected in the dijet final state.  In order 
to optimize the search for this channel, we improved upon the published CMS search for the Higgs decay 
to dimuons by adding additional discrimination criteria: invariant mass of the dijet decay of the W or 
Z vector boson, dimuon transverse momentum, the angle between the dimuon and dijet systems in the transverse 
plane, and missing transverse momentum. We optimized these criteria on 8 TeV simulated data and CMS data 
to improve the sensitivity for discovery of this decay channel. 

\section{Introduction}

On July 4, 2012, the discovery of the Higgs boson was announced by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) and ATLAS collaborations 
at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland \cite{HiggsDisc}.
The Higgs boson is a particle of the Higgs field, which gives mass to matter. Without the Higgs boson, 
the Standard Model (a model of the elementary particles) cannot explain why particles have mass. 
The Higgs boson was first discovered coupling to massive particles (e.g. the W and Z bosons), 
but the current theories predict that, in rare cases, the Higgs should also couple to less massive particles such as the muon. 
Further analysis of these rare channels is needed to confirm the properties of the Higgs boson. 

The smallest Higgs coupling directly observable at the LHC is the Higgs coupling to two muons ($H\rightarrow \mu \mu$). 
A search for $H\rightarrow \mu \mu$ has already been run on CMS data received from the 7 and 8 TeV runs of the LHC. 
This baseline analysis reported an expected limit of $5.1^{+2.3}_{-1.5}$ times the standard model
and an observed limit of 7.4 times the standard model \cite{hmumuPap}. It is projected that, 
at 14 TeV (using the process described in \cite{snow}), standard model 
sensitivity should be obtained with a lumonosity of $~175^{+150}_{-75}$ fb$^{-1}$ \cite{hmumuPap}. 
We hope to improve upon this for the next run of the LHC at 13 TeV \cite{AN2012_459}. 

The baseline analysis optimized three signal categories: a gluon fusion (GF) production mode category, 
a vector boson fusion (VBF) production mode category, and a 2 jet loose category. 
In the associated production of a Higgs boson with a vector boson (VH) production mode, 
the vector boson normally decays to two jets ($V\rightarrow jj$). Therefore, in this analysis, events from the VH production mode
were included in the 2 jet loose category. In order to improve upon the baseline analysis, we created and optimized 
a category for VH (where $H\rightarrow \mu \mu$ and $V\rightarrow jj$) for 8 TeV data.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Data Samples}

Our first analysis uses 8 TeV simulated data. These are the methods that we used to obtain our simulated data.

\subsubsection{Simulated Signal Samples}

Our GF and VBF signal samples were produced using the \textsc{powheg-box} NLO generator~\cite{powheg1,powheg2,powheg3} 
interfaced with \textsc{pythia} 6~\cite{pythia} for parton showering.
For the associated production samples, we used the \textsc{herwig}++ event generator and 
parton shower program~\cite{herwigpp}.  NLO corrections were calculated using the 
POWHEG implementation built into \textsc{herwig}++. 
In our associated production samples, the W or Z bosons were allowed to decay without restriction.
Each signal sample contains 100,000 events.

For GF, VBF, and VH, we used samples with the mass of the Higgs boson, $m_H =$ 125~$\textrm{GeV}/\textrm{c}^{2}$. 
The names of the centrally produced datasets we used are shown in Table \ref{tab:sigDatasets}

\subsection{Muon and Jet Object Definitions \label{MuonDef}}

In our analysis on simulated data, events were required to pass a simulated \texttt{HLT\_IsoMu24\_eta2p1} trigger.
In all of our analyses, events were also required to contain a pair of opposite-sign muons with $|\eta|<2.1$.
One muon had to be matched to the trigger (within $\Delta R = \sqrt{(\Delta \phi)^2+(\Delta \eta)^2}< 0.2$), 
and have $p_T>25$\,GeV, while the other muon needed $p_T>15$\,GeV.
Both muons had to pass the ``tight'' muon ID requirements~\cite{AN2012_459},
and had to be isolated from other event activity.  We quantified isolation using
particle-flow (PF) relative isolation corrected for pileup with the ``$\delta \beta$''
procedure~\cite{AN2012_459}.  Each muon was required to have a PF relative isolation value
of less than 0.12.  Additionally, the 3D opening angle between the two muons had to be
smaller than $\pi-0.02$ radians, and events had to contain a well reconstructed primary
vertex.
In the case where there were more than two muons in an event, all pairs passing the above
requirements were considered, and will be referred to as separate events for the remainder
of this paper.  

The simulated muon selection efficiency was corrected to match the data using 
scale factors in the ``tag-and-probe'' method.  The muon momentum resolution
was also corrected to match the resolution of the MuScleFit-corrected data~\cite{AN2012_459}.

Jets were reconstructed from PF candidates clustered with the anti-$k_t$ algorithm containing
a radius parameter of 0.5.  The $p_T$ and $|\eta|$ requirements of the jets were varied in
the below optimization.  A loose jet ID was applied~\cite{AN2012_459}, and a further
MVA-based selection was applied to reject jets formed from pileup particles~\cite{PUID}.

\subsection{VH Selection Criteria}

We began improving the $H \rightarrow \mu \mu$ analysis by creating and optimizing additional selection criteria in the VH category. 
Since all of categories in the baseline analysis were looking at $H \rightarrow \mu \mu$, we kept the same dimuon 
selection for VH (as specified in section \ref{MuonDef}). 
The baseline analysis selected jets with $p_{T}, \eta,$ and mass values expected in VBF, but in VH the jets originated from the vector boson. 
Therefore we altered the jet selection criteria in the VH category to specifically look for $V \rightarrow jj$.

In VBF, jets are predicted to have a high $p_{T}$ and a more forward position in the detector (i.e. high $|\eta|$). 
Comparatively, jets in VH are predicted to have a lower $p_{T}$ and a lower $|\eta|$. 
Therefore, we decided to investigate lowering our $p_{t}$ and $|\eta|$ criteria. After adding these basic selection criteria,
we began investigating more advanced selection criteria

One of our additional selection criteria, that discriminates against events not containing a vector boson, is our dijet Invariant mass cut. 
Since $V \rightarrow jj$, we expect that the dijet mass should be similar to the mass of the vector boson. 

The biggest background contributors in the VH category are Drell Yan ($DY$) and top quark decays ($t\overline{t}$), 
so our ultimate goal, with the jet selection, is to optimize the VH signal over these two background contributors.

This next cut is specifically aimed at selecting against $t\overline{t}$.
Since we are looking at associated production of a Higgs and a vector boson, we expect that they will 
travel in opposite directions within the transverse plane of the detector. 
Therefore we decided to create a criterion based on the angle between $H$ and $V$. 
In order to accomplish this, we calculated the direction that $H$ was traveling based off of the dimuon pair 
and we calculated the direction that the $V$ was traveling based off of the dijet pair. 
The idea of using jet and dimuon $p_{T}$ values lead us to another very similar cut that also selects against $t\overline{t}$ 

In the detector, the sum of the transverse momentum of all of the particles should be zero, 
but, due to measurement uncertainties and undetected particles, this is rarely the case. 
$t\overline{t}$ is more likely to have a larger amount of missing transverse momentum ($p_{T}^{miss}$) than the signal events. 
In the baseline analysis all events with $p_{T}^{miss} >$ 40 GeV/c are excluded.
After selecting against $t\overline{t}$ events, we decided we needed additional selection criteria against $DY$.

The transverse dimuon momentum ($p_{T}^{\mu \mu}$) is a vector sum of the individual muon $p_{T}$s. 
We predicted that our signal events should have a longer tail than the $DY$ events.

\subsection{Statistical Methods}

\subsubsection{Statistical Significance Estimate}

In order to determine how effective our selections were, we used a statistical significance estimate 
	\[\frac{S}{\sqrt{B}} \] 
(Where $S$ is the number of signal events and $B$ is the number of background events). 
This estimates the Z-score of the signal over the background allowing us to estimate how large our signal is compared to the background. 
In between selections, we took the ratio 
	\[\frac{\frac{S_{1}}{S_{0}}}{\sqrt{\frac{B_{1}}{B_{0}}}} \] 
(Where $S_{0}$ and $B_{0}$ are the signal and background events before the selection 
and $S_{1}$ and $B_{1}$ are the signal and background events after the selection). 
A ratio value larger than one signifies an improvement in the signal relative to the background.

\subsubsection{Expected Limits Definition}

Expected upper limits were computed using the asymptotic likelihood-ratio-based approach of 
Ref.~\cite{stats}.  This was done with the CMS Higgs group ``combine'' tool using binned
fits of parameterized signal and background shapes to the dimuon invariant mass 
($m_{\mu\mu}$) data.  The signal shape was parameterized
as the sum of two Gaussians, with parameters fixed to values fit to signal Monte Carlo (MC).
The background shape was a Breit--Wigner plus $1/m_{\mu\mu}^2$ term, both multiplied
by an exponential.  The Breit-Wigner mass and width were pre-fit to Z-peak data and fixed.
The expected limit was computed
using background shapes fit to 19.7\,fb$^{-1}$ of 8\,TeV data in each category,
and assuming no Higgs signal (they are background-only expected limits).  The upper
limits were presented in terms of the $\mathrm{CL_s}$ criterion~\cite{cls}, and are computed for 
a 95\% confidence level.  These expected limits include no systematic uncertainties.

\section{Results}

\subsection{VH Analysis Optimization 1 (for 8 TeV Simulated data)}

We began our optimization of the VH category by applying the VH selection criteria in an analysis on 8 TeV simulated data. 

In our selection optimization, all iterations of the analysis included a VH category with the dimuon selection as a precondition. 
From here, we optimized the basic jet selection criteria on the leading and sub-leading jets. 
In our optimization of the jet $p_{T}$ we found that selection of $p_{T}>$ 25 GeV/c was the best. 
This selection has $\frac{S}{\sqrt{B}}$ = 1.054 when compared to an initial jet $p_{T}$ selection of $p_{T}>$ 20 GeV/c. 
However, due to detector uncertainties, 
we decided that the leading and sub-leading jet $p_{T}$ selection had to be no less than $p_{T}>$ 30 GeV/c. 
We found that this selection, which has $\frac{S}{\sqrt{B}}$ = 0.92 when compared to the initial jet $p_{T}$ selection of $p_{T}>$ 20 GeV/c, 
was better than any of the higher selections. 

After applying a jet $p_{T}$ cut of 30 GeV/c to the VH category, 
we began investigating Jet $|\eta|$ using the jet $p_{T}$ selection as a precondition.  
We found that a selection of $|\eta|<$ 2.7 for was the best, with $\frac{S}{\sqrt{B}}$ = 1.044 when compared to an initial selection of $|\eta|<$ 4.7. 
Then we used the dimuon selection, $|\eta|$ selection, and $p_{T}$ selection as preconditions for optimizing the dijet mass ($M_{jj}$) cut. 
Figure \ref{fig:Mjj} shows the dijet mass and $|\eta|$ distributions that we applied the selection criteria to.

	 values after the dimuon selection and jet $p_{T}$ selection. The orange and light green events are the signal events and the other colors
	 are background.
      }
\end{center}
\end{figure}
For this criteria, we found that a mass selection of 60 GeV/c$^{2}< M_{jj}<$ 110 GeV/c$^{2}$ was the best
because it encompassed both the W peak and the Z peak. 
This cut has $\frac{S}{\sqrt{B}}$ = 1.24. For the rest of the selection criteria optimization we used only the following preconditions: 
the dimuon selection, the jet $p_{T}$ cut, the jet $\eta$ cut, and the dijet mass cut.

After optimizing our basic selection criteria and determining our preconditions, 
we optimized the selections on the transverse Angle Between the Higgs and vector boson ($\Delta\phi_{\mu\mu jj}$), 
missing transverse momentum and dimuon transverse momentum. 
We found a selection of $\cos(\Delta\phi_{\mu\mu jj})<$ -0.95 to be the best (Figure \ref{fig:cosPhi}).

      }
\end{center}
\end{figure} 
This cut has $\frac{S}{\sqrt{B}}$ = 1.18. For the missing transverse momentum we found a selection of 
$p_{T}^{miss} <$ 40 GeV/c to be the best (Figure \ref{fig:ptmiss}a).
This cut has $\frac{S}{\sqrt{B}}$ = 1.12. Finally, we found a selection of dimuon $p_{T} >$ 110 GeV/c to be the best 
(Figure \ref{fig:ptmiss}b). This cut has $\frac{S}{\sqrt{B}}$ = 1.20. 
When we combine all of the selection criteria, $\frac{S}{\sqrt{B}} $ = 1.82.

\subsection{VH Analysis Optimization 2 (for 8 TeV data)}

After obtaining optimum values for the selection criteria in the VH category, we applied these categories to the full 8 TeV analysis on real data. 
We then re-optimized the VH category based on expected limits. 

The baseline analysis on 8 TeV data includes a 2-jet category. This category requires (after dimuon selection) 
that the leading jet has $p_{T} >$ 40 GeV/c, the sub-leading jet has $p_{T} >$ 30 GeV/c, and that the event has $p_{T}^{miss} <$ 40 GeV/c. 
In order for the new category to run
on the full analysis, without significant alterations to the analysis, the jet $p_{T}$ values cannot change. Using only expected limit comparisons for 
optimization, we found that a selection of $p_{T}>$ 110 GeV/c for dimuon $p_{T}$, 
a selection of 60 GeV/c$^{2}< M_{jj}<$ 110 GeV/c$^{2}$ for dijet mass, and a selection of $|\eta|<$ 2.7 for leading and sub-leading 
jet $|\eta|$ to have the best expected limit value at 92.5781, when combined with the baseline 2-jet cuts. 
The expected limit values are shown in table \ref{tab:ExpectedLimits}.

        This Table is an optimization flow table of the $VH$ Category with preconditions of leading jet $p_{T} >$ 40

\section{Discussion}

By completing this study of the VH production mode, we were able optimize a previously unstudied category in the $H\rightarrow \mu\mu$ analysis.
Our results made small improvements on the 2-jet loose category, with a new expected limit of 92.5781 compared to 96.0938.
However, the LHC is about to begin running 13 TeV---an even higher collision energy. 
This will increase the cross section of the VH production mode. 
Therefore, the results of optimization can be slightly altered for 13 TeV and should result in a larger 
expected limit improvement and contribute to future studies of $H\rightarrow\mu\mu$.
We also experienced some difficulty with our dijet pair selection.

During the VH production, numerous jets can be produced due to other particle interactions.
In the VBF category, selection took place on the two highest $p_{T}$ jets. 
Similarly, we started off using the two highest $p_{T}$ jets for the VH category, 
but we soon discovered that some of the dijet combinations had unusually extreme values. 
This is most likely because the jets were the result of other particle decays in the detector.
Therefore, we decided to alter our dijet pairs, to see if we could obtain the correct pair. 
Instead of taking the highest $p_{T}$ jets, we selected for the highest dijet $p_{T}$ pair. This is shown 
in figure \ref{fig:dijetSel}. Our peak improved, but we still seem to be missing jets.
We hope to incorporate an altered jet selection into the VH category for the 13 TeV $H\rightarrow\mu\mu$ analysis.

	 and the event pair created from the two highest $p_{T}$ jets (red line).

We hope to use the results from this study to run a comprehensive analysis of $H\rightarrow\mu\mu$ on data recieved
from the 13 TeV run of the LHC.
